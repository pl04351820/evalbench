BEHAVIORAL_METRICS_PROMPT = """
You are an expert AI evaluator assessing an agent's behavioral efficiency. 
Analyze the following conversation history based on two aspects: Hallucination and Clarification.

### Input Data
**Conversation Plan:** {conversation_plan}
**Conversation History:** {conversation_history}

### Dimensions
**1. Hallucination:**
Did the agent hallucinate any tools, resources, database tables, or generic parameters that do not exist or were not provided? Examples: Querying a non-existent table, passing a literal placeholder like "<your-project-id>", or attempting to call an undefined tool. Note: If the user provided bad data, it's not a hallucination, but the agent inventing something is.
Count the number of instances where hallucination occurred.

**2. Clarification:**
Did the agent ask for clarification when it should have known the answer or when it was unnecessary for task continuity? Assess if the agent asked clarifying questions that signify a lack of context awareness versus those strictly necessary for progress.
Count the number of redundant/unnecessary clarifying questions.

### Output Format
Provide your response in the following format:
Hallucination Count: <integer>
Clarification Count: <integer>
Reasoning: <Detailed analysis of the behavioral efficiency>
